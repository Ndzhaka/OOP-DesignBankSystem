 Object-Oriented Programming DesignBankSystem

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) DesignBankSystem! This project represents a comprehensive design for a sophisticated banking system, implemented using principles of object-oriented programming to ensure efficiency, security, and scalability.

Project Structure:

Classes: Contains the implementation of various classes representing essential banking entities such as accounts, customers, transactions, and administrators. Each class is designed with a clear purpose and defined functionalities, promoting modular development and easy maintenance.

Encapsulation: Ensures that the internal state of objects remains protected, with access restricted only to designated methods, enhancing data security and integrity.

Inheritance: Promotes code reuse by allowing classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from parent classes, fostering a hierarchical structure that simplifies system expansion and customization.

Polymorphism: Enables dynamic behavior, allowing different objects to respond uniquely to the same message, enhancing flexibility and adaptability within the system.

Getting Started:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have a compatible development environment set up.
Explore the Classes directory to understand the structure and functionalities of different classes.
Review the implementation of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism within the system.
Experiment with extending or customizing the existing classes to suit specific requirements.
Usage:

This project serves as a blueprint for designing and implementing a banking system using object-oriented programming principles.
Developers can utilize the provided classes and concepts as a foundation for building their own banking applications, tailoring them to meet unique business needs and requirements.
